# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-THE-FUSION-OF-ML-AND-MEDICAL-IMAGING-
Brain tumor detection using ML and medical imaging enhances accuracy and efficiency. This approach leverages deep learning to automate tumor identification, reducing errors and aiding early diagnosis for better patient outcomes.
Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as MRI scans and CT scans, heavily rely on manual interpretation by radiologists, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. The complexity of tumor detection, variations in tumor size, shape, and location, and the need for precise classification between benign and malignant tumors present significant challenges in medical imaging.

This research aims to develop an advanced machine learning (ML)-powered approach that integrates medical imaging techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection. By leveraging deep learning models, computer vision, and radiological data fusion, the system will automatically analyze medical images, classify tumor types, and assist radiologists in making more precise and faster diagnoses. The proposed solution seeks to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce false positives and negatives, and support early detection, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and optimized healthcare processes.
